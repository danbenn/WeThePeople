In this assignment, you are to present your Product Design. Turn in a presentation slide pack consisting of the following:

1. Title with elevator pitch and team slides from your last assignment, incorporating any changes necessary.

2. User personas (33%): create at least 1 persona per customer segment, minimum 3 personas total. Each user persona captures a composite image of a typical customer in its respective segment, in terms of customer's needs, wants, and pain points. Each persona must contain demographic info, bio, motivations (needs), goals (wants), and frustrations (pain points) information of the user. Additionally, you could construct the user's personality, technological affinity, and brand awareness if these are relevant to your product. You should interview at least 3 people per user persona. Preferably these would be people you have not interviewed before. However, if the user pool of a particular customer segment that you can reach is limited, e.g., people over 100 years old, you may go back to the same people.

3. Product features (25%): Construct a story map for the user experience flow of your product and break it down into stages, with associated features per stage. Define which features will be in your skeletal product and which features will be in your MVP. Each non-trivial feature should have associated with it a user story compiled from affinity mapping of your user interviews above. (See  lecture on UX/UI design if you don't recall what Affinity Mapping is. See lecture on MVP if you don't recall what a Story Map or a user story is.) Each user story must address a certain TYPE of user, performing specific ACTION, for a specific REASON. As a counter example, "I am a reader and I want to buy books" is not a very useful user story. For each non-trivial task, assign one or more member to work on it. List all third-party libraries or tools you plan to use.

4. UI/UX (22%): provide two alternative UIs created by two independent sub-teams in isolation from each other. Mock up each UI using Sketch, marvel, or simply hand drawn. Back up each UI with its UX flow: story board how users will use your app given each UI. (For an example of storyboarding, see lecture on UX/UI.) Consult also the required readings:

Babich, N., Storyboarding in UX Design (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., Apr. 2017.
Storyboards (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
Cao, J., A Practical Look At Using Wireframes (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
List all third-party libraries or tools you plan to use.

5. Back-end architecture (20%): list all components of your back-end architecture and how they tie together: will you be using DigitalOcean? Firebase? Tomcat? Mysql? Django? Python? Flask? Java? Describe also how your front-end would communicate with your back-end: list and describe your APIs. List all third-party libraries or tools you plan to use.

6. Update your Gantt Chart and VPC as necessary based on the above. If you update either one of them, include your updated version in your presentation pack. (We may not ask you to present the updated version in class, but we'd still like to see them offline. They will count towards your VPC and team management grades.)

Each team will have only about 18 minutes to present. So, focus on presenting your UI mockup and UX story board and feature story map. If time permits, you can present your user personas, user stories, and backend architecture. Most likely we will read these offline. Please take your time usage into account when preparing your presentation.

This assignment is worth 15% of your course grade and is DUE Thu, 10/12, 2 pm.

Name your submission file: Design Presentation

Format: Adobe PDF (preferred) or Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote.
